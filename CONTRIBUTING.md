## Introduction
If you're reading this, you're interested in contributing to the Discord Bot project. Good on you. Let's make this as painless as possible.

## Code of Conduct
Be a decent human being. No harassment, no discrimination. If you can't play nice, you can't play here.

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo.git`
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## Pull Request Process
1. Make your changes. Test them. Then test them again.
2. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
3. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
4. Create a Pull Request (PR) from your fork to the main repo.
5. Fill out the PR template and explain your changes.
6. Wait for a review. Make any required changes.
7. Once approved, your changes will be merged.

## Issue Reporting
1. Check if the issue already exists. If not, create a new one.
2. Use the issue template and fill in all the required details.
3. Attach screenshots or logs if possible.

## Testing
Make sure to write tests for your code. We're not animals. Run the existing tests to make sure you didn't break anything.

## Style Guide
Follow the existing code style. If in doubt, refer to popular style guides.

## Final Notes
- Make sure to update the README if you introduce new features or change existing ones.
- Don't introduce breaking changes without prior discussion.
